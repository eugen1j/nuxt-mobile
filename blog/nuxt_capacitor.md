# How to create Android and iOS apps from NuxtJS application

If you have a NuxtJS web app, and you need to have some native features or use AppStore and PlayMarket as a distribution channels, you can use CapacitorJS to turn it to Android and iOS applications.


## Install Nuxt 

If you already have a NuxtJS web application you can jump to the [Add CapacitorJS](#Add CapacitorJS) section

Installing nuxt3 https://v3.nuxtjs.org/getting-started/quick-start

```
$ npx nuxi init nuxt-mobile
$ cd nuxt-mobile
$ yarn install
```

Let's change `app.vue`

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Nuxt Mobile</h1>

    <p>This is the very basic example of mobile app built with NuxtJS and CapacitorJS</p>
  </div>
</template>
```

```
$ yarn dev -o
```

Look at the browser.

## Add CapacitorJS

Add capacitor https://capacitorjs.com/docs/getting-started

```
$ yarn add @capacitor/core
$ yarn add --dev @capacitor/cli
```

Initialize proj 

```
$ yarn cap init
```

I'll pick Name: NuxtMobile; Package:  com.mycompany.nuxtmobile;  Web asset directory â€¦ dist

Check `capacitor.config.json`


## Add Android and iOS packages

```
$ yarn add @capacitor/android @capacitor/ios
```

We need a static site to build mobile app. So, run 

```
$ yarn generate 
```

Now we have static site, so we can init ios and android app

```
$ yarn cap add android
$ yarn cap add ios
```

We created folders `android` and `ios` with native apps. 

If you want to change site, you need to run `yarn generate` to generate a static site and `npx cap sync` update native apps.


## Running Android app

You can run Android on any OS.

Install https://developer.android.com/studio.

Run `yarn cap open android`. This will open AndroidStudio.

We need to add an emulator to run. Go to the Tools -> Device Manager, click Create Device. 

First, you need to pick Hardware device. I'll go with `Pixel 2`.

Then, you need to download and pick Android OS image. I will use `API 33`.

Then click 'Next' and 'Finish'.

After this you will see a new device on the 'Devices' dropdown. Now, you can click 'Run' to build and start application:

Click Run  `Pixel 2 API 33`. Then you can click Run `app`.

You will see:

## Running iOS app

You need mac to run iOS emulator.

You need to have XCode installed. 

Run `yarn cap open ios`. This will open XCode.

You can pick any device as emulator. I'm ok with iPod touch.

Then click 'Run'. XCode will build app and run it on the device.

After build, you will see a running application on iOS emulator.

## Congrats!

In this guide we turn our NuxtJS application into Android and iOS applications.
